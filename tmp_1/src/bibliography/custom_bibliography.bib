  abstract     = {Recent dramatic increase in e-commerce has also increased the adoption of automation technologies in warehouses. Autonomous mobile robots ({AMRs}) are from those technologies widely utilized in warehouse operations. It is important to design the operation of those robotic systems in such a way that, they meet the current and future system requirements correctly. In this paper, we study flexible travel of {AMRs} in warehouses by developing smart deadlock and collision prevention algorithms on agent-based modelling. By that, {AMR} agents can interact with each other and environment, so that they can make smart decisions maximizing their goals. We compare the performance of the developed flexible travel system with non-flexible designs where there is a single {AMR} dedicated to a specific zone so that no deadlock or collision possibility takes place. The results show that {AMRs} may provide up to 39\% improvement in the flexible system compared to its non-flexible design.},
